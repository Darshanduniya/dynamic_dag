Request for 3 Days Leave Due to Family Function

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to request a 3-day leave from [start date] to [end date] as I need to attend an important family function in Mumbai. Since the function is closely related to our family, it is mandatory for us to be present, and we will be traveling out of state.

I have ensured that my current tasks are up to date and have briefed [colleagueâ€™s name] to handle any urgent matters in my absence.

Thank you for your understanding and support.
